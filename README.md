I have used only 2 entities to keep the things simple and focused on the required APIs. I have assumed user can be any medical staff (doctor, nurse, consultant etc). First time, a user need to register himself using the required fields. 

Post that, a user need to login himself/herself and then they can add patient, find all patient, find the heartrate or record the heartrate. However, here, I have not used any authentication or authorisation protocols as it was not required.

Database, I have used is H2-console to avoid any unnecessary installations of database.
